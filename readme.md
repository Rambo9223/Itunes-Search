Plan 

Page front-end

A form containing:
- A search bar attached to a useState value, where the user can type in the criteria
- check box inputs that allow user to select type of content(movie,podcast,music,audiobook,short film, TV Show,software, eBook or All) if all is selected all other checkboxes are unchecked
- search button on click fetches from the API 
- section for the content to be returned to the user, with button rendered on to it giving user option to add to list, (onclick should add item to the favourites list)

To keep 
Keep list but is going to change  favourites user adds

add function(POST)

delete function(DELETE) 

could use routes to have list on a separate page

To remove

We don't require an edit function so can remove the edit functions from GetData, Edit(components) and the PUT functions from the backend

Page Backend - 

helmet added to node, no idea wtf it does, just another add in from hyperion with no explanation whatsoever 

Keep 

GET X 2 = retrieve data from searches & retrieve the list of favourites
POST = option to add new item to favourites list 
DELETE = remove item from favourites list 

Remove 

old paths and functions 
will need one local path to json file 
and another to the itunes API
